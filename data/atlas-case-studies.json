In the MathGPT application, GPT-3 is used to convert the user's natural language question into Python code that is then executed. After computation, the executed code and the answer are displayed to the user.\n\nSome LLMs can be vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious user inputs cause the models to perform unexpected behavior[<sup>\\[3\\]</sup>][3][<sup>\\[4\\]</sup>][4].   In this incident, the actor explored several prompt-override avenues, producing code that eventually led to the actor gaining access to the application host system's environment variables and the application's GPT-3 API key, as well as executing a denial of service attack.  As a result, the actor could have exhausted the application's API query budget or brought down the application.\n\nAfter disclosing the attack vectors and their results to the MathGPT and Streamlit teams, the teams took steps to mitigate the vulnerabilities, filtering on select prompts and rotating the API key.\n\n[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03874 \"Measuring Mathematical Problem Solving With the MATH Dataset\"\n[2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14168 \"Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems\"\n[3]: https://lspace.swyx.io/p/reverse-prompt-eng \"Reverse Prompt Engineering for Fun and (no) Profit\"\n[4]: https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/12/05/exploring-prompt-injection-attacks/ \"Exploring prompt-based attacks\"",

The worm uses an adversarial self-replicating prompt which uses prompt injection to replicate the prompt as output and perform malicious activity.\nThe researchers demonstrate how this worm can propagate through an email system with a RAG-based assistant. They use a target system that automatically ingests received emails, retrieves past correspondences, and generates a reply for the user. To carry out the attack, they send a malicious email containing the adversarial self-replicating prompt, which ends up in the RAG database. The malicious instructions in the prompt tell the assistant to include sensitive user data in the response. Future requests to the email assistant may retrieve the malicious email. This leads to propagation of the worm due to the self-replicating portion of the prompt, as well as leaking private information due to the malicious instructions.",

    "summary": "Researchers at Trend Micro, Inc. used service indexing portals and web searching tools to identify over 8,000 misconfigured private container registries exposed on the internet. Approximately 70% of the registries also had overly permissive access controls that allowed write access. In their analysis, the researchers found over 1,000 unique AI models embedded in private container images within these open registries that could be pulled without authentication.\n\nThis exposure could allow adversaries to download, inspect, and modify container contents, including sensitive AI model files. This is an exposure of valuable intellectual property which could be stolen by an adversary. Compromised images could also be pushed to the registry, leading to a supply chain attack, allowing malicious actors to compromise the integrity of AI models used in production systems.",

Then they use prompt injections to discover details about the AI agent, such as its knowledge sources and tools. Once they understand the AI agent’s capabilities, the researchers are able to craft a prompt that retrieves private customer data from the organization’s RAG database and CRM, and exfiltrate it via the AI agent’s email tool.\n\nVendor Response: Microsoft quickly acknowledged and fixed the issue.
